## Viral Cards

A small card game made in about 10 hours during my free time on [LivreGameJam](https://livregamejam.org/).

### How to play

You can access the itch.io link to play it on the browser (https://illusionfisherman.itch.io/viral-cards).

### How to compile

You'll need Node Package Manager to do that.

1. Clone this remo (`git clone [this repo address]`).
2. Install stuff (`npm install`).

Done, basically. All the code is on the `/src` folder, and unless explicitily saying otherwise, it is GPL3 licensed.

### Making-of

I was working on LivreGameJam as a staff, so I barely had time to create this game. Fortunately I downscaled its scope until I could finish it (even if it doesn't have an ending screen per-se, haha).

All assets were captured by my phone (both sound and graphics); I edited them using Audacity (audio) and Gimp (images).

The game itself was created using Phaser javascript framework. I already had a sample code for a simple 2D card animation I previosly created for another game; I modified it to the purposes of this game. I also used my Phaser boilerplate (it has some screen-resolution settings and manages automatically for me the preloading of assets using JSON). Everything else (game logic, animations, etc.) was created on the run.

### Credits
